# === DEFINE SLAB LAYERING ============================================

# Either use custom profile
myprofile = [[108, 360]]  # (N) last slab layer above weak layer

# Or select a predefined profile from database
# myprofile = 'medium'

# Example with a crack cut from the right-hand side.

# Input
totallength = 4000                      # Total length (mm)
cracklength = 1200.0                       # Crack length (mm)
inclination = 0                      # Slope inclination (Â°)

# === CREATE MODEL INSTANCES ==========================================
# Propagation saw test cut from the right side with custom layering
pst_cut_right = weac.Layered(system='pst-', layers=myprofile, phi=inclination)

# === INSPECT LAYERING ================================================
weac.plot.slab_profile(pst_cut_right)

# Obtain lists of segment lengths, locations of foundations,
# and position and magnitude of skier loads from inputs. We
# can choose to analyze the situtation before a crack appears
# even if a cracklength > 0 is set by replacing the 'crack'
# key thorugh the 'nocrack' key.
seg_pst = pst_cut_right.calc_segments(
    L=totallength, a=cracklength)['crack']

# Assemble system of linear equations and solve the
# boundary-value problem for free constants.

C_pst = pst_cut_right.assemble_and_solve(
    phi=inclination, **seg_pst)

# Prepare the output by rasterizing the solution vector at all
# horizontal positions xsl (slab). The result is returned in the
# form of the ndarray z. Also provides xwl (weak layer) that only
# contains x-coordinates that are supported by a foundation.
xsl_pst, z_pst, xwl_pst = pst_cut_right.rasterize_solution(
    C=C_pst, phi=inclination, **seg_pst)

# === VISUALIZE RESULTS =====================================
